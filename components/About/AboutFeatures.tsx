    description:
      "Kenyan theatre is characterised by a great presence in a few towns and cities, with Nairobi leading the lot by a huge margin. While the history of theatre suggests that it was one of the major community-based activities, urbanisation and formalisation of the craft have made it dwindle in rural areas. KITFest, through the County Tours and Community Theatre projects, seeks to reintroduce theatre back to the villages as a powerful advocacy tool, teaching platform, source of livelihood and a quality socio-cultural community element.",
